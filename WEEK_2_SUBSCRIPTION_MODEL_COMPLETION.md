#  **Week 2 Completion: Multi-Tenant Backend with New Subscription Model**

##  **Overview**
Successfully completed Week 2 of Phase 5, implementing a comprehensive multi-tenant backend with a new subscription model featuring a 4-day free trial and three paid tiers.

##  **Completed Features**

### **1. New Subscription Model**
- **7-Day Free Trial**: All new users start with a 7-day trial period
- **Pro Plan ($10/month)**: Individual professional users
- **Plus Plan ($19/month)**: Enhanced individual and professional users  
- **Teams Plan ($49/month + $12/user)**: Team collaboration and enterprise features

### **2. Multi-Tenant Architecture**
- **User Isolation**: Complete data separation between users
- **User-Specific RAG Engines**: Separate ChromaDB instances per user
- **Row-Level Security**: Supabase RLS policies for data protection
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based user authentication

### **3. Quota Management System**
- **Trial Tier**: 120 requests, 50k tokens
- **Pro Tier**: 1,000 requests, 1M tokens
- **Plus Tier**: 2,500 requests, 2.5M tokens
- **Teams Tier**: 5,000 requests, 5M tokens

### **4. API Endpoints**
- **Authentication**: `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`
- **User Management**: `/user/profile`, `/user/config`, `/user/notion-integration`
- **Subscription**: `/user/trial-status`, `/user/upgrade-subscription`, `/subscription/plans`
- **Agent Operations**: `/agent/run`, `/agent/sync`
- **Task Management**: `/tasks/search`, `/tasks/{task_id}`, `/tasks`
- **Usage Analytics**: `/usage/summary`, `/usage/logs`, `/usage/quota`
- **Admin**: `/admin/users` (Teams tier only)

##  **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Updated User model with trial support
users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email TEXT UNIQUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP,
  notion_access_token TEXT,
  notion_workspace_id TEXT,
  subscription_tier TEXT DEFAULT 'trial',
  trial_ends_at TIMESTAMP,  -- NEW: 4-day trial period
  team_id UUID,             -- NEW: Team collaboration
  team_role TEXT            -- NEW: Team member role
)
```

### **Subscription Tiers**
```python
class SubscriptionTier(str, Enum):
    TRIAL = "trial"    # 4-day free trial
    PRO = "pro"        # Individual plan
    PLUS = "plus"      # Enhanced individual and professional plan
    TEAMS = "teams"    # Team collaboration plan
```

### **Quota Limits**
```python
tier_limits = {
    SubscriptionTier.TRIAL: {"requests": 50, "tokens": 50000},
    SubscriptionTier.PRO: {"requests": 1000, "tokens": 1000000},
    SubscriptionTier.PLUS: {"requests": 2500, "tokens": 2500000},
    SubscriptionTier.TEAMS: {"requests": 5000, "tokens": 5000000}
}
```

##  **Files Modified/Created**
