## 🚨 **ERRORS FACED & SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED**

### **Error 1: LLM Response Inconsistency**
**Problem**: LLM worked on first call but failed with "LLM response has no candidates" on subsequent calls.

**Root Cause**: Incomplete message history accumulation that confused the LLM.

**Solution**: 
- Temporarily disabled message history accumulation to prevent context issues
- Each reasoning call is now independent and doesn't get confused by incomplete conversation history

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Commented out message history handling in reasoning_node
# For now, don't add previous messages to prevent context issues
# This will be fixed in a future iteration with proper conversation management
```

### **Error 2: Infinite Loop / Recursion Limit**
**Problem**: Agent getting stuck in infinite loop, hitting LangGraph recursion limit of 25.

**Root Cause**: Agent continuously searching for tasks but not finding specific task IDs, causing repeated search_tasks calls.

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Reduced Loop Count Limit**:
```python
# Prevent infinite loops (max 5 iterations to be safe)
if loop_count >= 5:
    logger.warning("Agent ending due to maximum loop count reached")
    return "end"
```

2. **Search Loop Detection**:
```python
# Detect if we're stuck in a search loop
if loop_count >= 3:
    recent_actions = state.get("recent_actions", [])
    if len(recent_actions) >= 3:
        if all(action == "search_tasks" for action in recent_actions[-3:]):
            logger.warning("Agent ending due to search loop detection")
            return "end"
```

3. **Action Tracking**:
```python
# Track recent actions for loop detection
if "recent_actions" not in state:
    state["recent_actions"] = []
state["recent_actions"].append(next_action)

# Keep only the last 5 actions to prevent memory bloat
if len(state["recent_actions"]) > 5:
    state["recent_actions"] = state["recent_actions"][-5:]
```

4. **Improved Fallback Logic**:
```python
# Check if we've already searched recently to prevent loops
recent_actions = state.get("recent_actions", [])
if recent_actions and recent_actions[-1] == "search_tasks":
    # We just searched, so end the session to prevent loops
    state["next_action"] = "end"
    logger.info("Already searched recently, ending session to prevent loops")
```

### **Error 3: Empty Query Validation**
**Problem**: "content must not be empty in query" error in RAG engine.

**Solution**: Added validation with fallback to default query.
```python
# Ensure query is not empty
if not query or not query.strip():
    query = "pending tasks"
    logger.info(f"Empty query provided, using default: {query}")
```

### **Error 4: Task ID vs Title Confusion**
**Problem**: Agent trying to use task titles instead of Notion page IDs.

**Solution**: Added detection and search fallback for task titles.
```python
# If task_id is a title (not a UUID), we need to search for it first
if task_id and not task_id.startswith(("21", "22", "23", "24", "25", "26", "27", "28", "29", "30")):
    # This is likely a task title, not an ID - search for it
    state["next_action"] = "search_tasks"
    state["current_query"] = task_id
    state["pending_update"] = {
        "properties": properties,
        "original_task_id": task_id
    }
```
