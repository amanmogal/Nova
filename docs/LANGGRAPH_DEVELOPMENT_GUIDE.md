 I'll search for LangGraph documentation and keep it in memory for error-free development. Let me search for relevant information about LangGraph in the codebase and then gather documentation.

Now let me search for LangGraph documentation and best practices to keep in memory for error-free development:

```bash
python -c "import langgraph; print(f'LangGraph version: {langgraph.__version__}')"
```
```bash
python -c "import langgraph; print(dir(langgraph))"
```
```bash
python -c "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph; print('StateGraph imported successfully')"
```
```bash
python -c "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph; help(StateGraph)" | head -50
```
```bash
python -c "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph; print(StateGraph.__doc__)"
```
```bash
python -c "from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver; print(MemorySaver.__doc__)"
```
```bash
python -c "from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages; print(add_messages.__doc__)"
```
Let me create a comprehensive LangGraph documentation reference file to keep in memory for error-free development:

Now let me create a quick reference card for common LangGraph patterns and error prevention:

Now let me create a validation script to check the current LangGraph implementation for common issues:

Now let me run the validation script to check the current LangGraph implementation:

```bash
python validate_langgraph.py
