## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Loop Detection System**
```python
# Reduced loop count limit from 5 to 3 iterations
if loop_count >= 3:
    return "end"

# Search loop detection after 2 consecutive searches
if all(action == "search_tasks" for action in recent_actions[-2:]):
    return "end"

# Total search limit of 3 searches
if search_count >= 3:
    return "end"
```

### **Recursion Limit Optimization**
```python
# Reduced LangGraph recursion limit from 25 to 10
config = {
    "recursion_limit": 10  # Reduced from default 25
}
```

### **Task ID Validation & Recovery**
```python
# Enhanced task ID detection
if task_id and not task_id.startswith(("21", "22", "23", "24", "25", "26", "27", "28", "29", "30")):
    # Handle task title vs ID confusion
    state["next_action"] = "search_tasks"
```

### **Error Recovery Mechanisms**
```python
# Graceful fallback for missing task IDs
if not tasks_with_ids:
    state["next_action"] = "send_notification"
    state["notification_message"] = "Daily planning completed: Found tasks but unable to schedule due to missing task IDs."
```
